Simple Mod for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition which prevents new (oreui) from being used and uses old ui instead

ðŸ§© How to Use

Download the DLL for your Minecraft version from the Releases page.

Rename the file to vcruntime140_1.dll.

Place it in your Minecraft installation folder (the same directory as Minecraft.Windows.exe).

Launch the game â€” it should use old ui now.

Thatâ€™s it! No extra setup required.
