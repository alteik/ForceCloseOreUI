Simple Mod for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition which prevents new (oreui) from being used and uses old ui instead

ðŸ§© How to Use

Download the DLL for your Minecraft version from the Releases page.

Download [ModLoader](https://github.com/alteik/ModLoader) from my github profile.

Setup it (instructions can be found on ModLoader github page)

Place mod in C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft Bedrock\mods

note: if folder doesnt exists, start mc once for ModLoader to create it

Launch the game â€” it should use old ui now.

Thatâ€™s it! No extra setup required.
